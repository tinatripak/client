# Client part of a portfolio site for a photographer

The client is deployed on the website https://ksigallery.vercel.app/. 
It is written using React library. For API I used my API from https://github.com/tinatripak/photograph-portfolio-server.

To run the client I need to run the "npm install" and "npm start" commands.
